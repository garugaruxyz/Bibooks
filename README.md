# 2022 UNIMIB Assignment 3 Spring application (MVC and data persistency)

The application must implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and at least a search operation
on a set of entities (the search operation must work with at least two entities in a relationship,
searching for a single entity by ids or attributes is not enough).
There must be at least 4 entities in the system (with inheritance between at least 2 of entities) and at
least 3 relationships (including at least a many-to-many and a self-loop relationship) between those
entities. Arbitrarily define entities and attributes.
The “front-end only” implementation works with volatile objects. The “back-end only”
implementation implements a Java interface that can be executed with a main or a set of Junit test
cases. The “front-end + back-end implementation” implements both a Web-based front-end and a
back-end that handles the persistent objects.
